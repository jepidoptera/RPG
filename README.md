A dark and fatalistic RPG.  Spoiler alert: you're gonna lose.

This represents an early attempt by me to use Jquery and timeouts to create an asynchronous, graphical, event-driven game.  The characters have differing stats and abilities which are designed to interact in various ways, so that some characters' advantages are cancelled out by others.
